## Version: 0.1.18052022
- Added checksum for sha256
- Unsupported type ERROR in fl now print detected Type
- Pubkey conversion functions added pub2upub, to_cpub, point_to_cpub
- function bloom_check_add_mcpu added for later use
- bloom_para, Fill_in_bloom, check_in_bloom helpful wrappers for bloom creation and test
- prepare_bin_file, prepare_bin_file_work ideally to be used with rmd or eth to create .bin file
- Once created the bloom can be saved and reloaded by dump_bloom_file, read_bloom_file
- Option from .bin sorted file __20 byte each item__ to directly load into RAM using Load_data_to_memory
- check for existence using check_collision function alongside Load_data_to_memory
